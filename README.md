An application that allows you to view and save google books.

To use, simply type into the search bar, a book title, or author name (or both) and click 'submit'.

Once search results have appeared you can save them to the database by clicking "save".

A green notice will appear in the bottom of the screen when a book has been saved to the database. This notice will appear regardless of whether you are the person who saved the book or not. (This uses socket.io to connect)

You can also click on the "save" button in the navbar to be taken to a page that lists all books that have been saved to the database. Each book should appear with a "delete" button that will remove the book from the database.
